        "###The F1 score differs from precision and recall in that it considers both metrics when calculating overall accuracy. While precision and recall focus on different aspects of a model's performance, the F1 score provides a way to balance them. A high F1 score indicates that a model has both high precision and high recall, and therefore is able to correctly identify positive instances while minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n",

In some applications, precision may be more important than recall (e.g., spam filtering), while in other applications, recall may be more important than precision (e.g., disease diagnosis). In such cases, precision or recall may be a better metric to use depending on the specific application."

The softmax function is used to transform the outputs of the model into a set of probabilities that sum up to 1.\n",
